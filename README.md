# hubway-maps
A visualization integrating hubway bike ride data with socioeconomic datasets.

The intention of this project was to understand how the number of hubway stations in a census tracts related to the poverty rate. 
Using data from Cambridge, MA, we created several visualizations: 
- A heatmap of Cambridge tracts visualizing poverty rate.
- An interactive graph of hubway stations per track versus poverty rate.

This project was made at the 2017 Brown University Data Science Datathon and used d3.js, HTML5 Boilerplate, and node.js.
